<p>But fortunately, there is DISCO which is a framework tailored exactly to your needs: it will relieve you from this entire complicated workflow and just deploy everything which you need â€“ so that you can dedicate yourself to the main thing which matters: your <strong>Big Data analysis</strong>!</p>
