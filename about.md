### What is DISCO - and why do I need it?

DISCO provides an entire distributed computing architecture conveniently as a service. The dashboard takes the requirements over an easy-to-use web interface and the backend creates the entire cluster with the chosen distributed computing engines ready to use. Doing Big Data analysis can't get any easier than that!


### What do I need to benefit from DISCO?

The only thing you need is a provisioned OpenStack installation. You can install DISCO either on a Virtual Machine on that same cluster or on a dedicated physical machine. You can even install the dashboard separately from the backend - it's totally up to you!
